# LinkedIN_Scraper
This program is used to scrap the LinkedIN jobs page details into CSV file containing the job title, job location and many more. This Script is written in python3 and the library used is Selenium. This Selenium library handles the all the automation stuff like opening of browser , put request to website fill search box and scraping stuff. 

For using the selenium first download the geckodriver driver which is a driver for firefox browser and chromedriver for chrome browser. I used so Firefox browser so, i have included the geckodriver in this repository so, no need to download externally.
